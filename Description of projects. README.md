This folder contains three projects I did in my python introductory class. In "Project 1," I used the library "csv" to retrive data from a file called zonann_temps. In "Project 2,"
I used "PIL" to create four filtering functions that could access and filter images; I put all functions together into project() and made them create a new image with distinct filters from the three
jpg. images combined. In "Project 3," I created a game called "Avoid the X's" using the "Random" class; I implemented 8 functions, each for: running the game, running each of the five levels,
displaying the instructions, displaying the game board, displaying the lives and the numbers selected in the game board, comparing the numbers you and the computer selected, and displaying
the "GG" or the "XX" result on the board. For further details, please see each project file.
